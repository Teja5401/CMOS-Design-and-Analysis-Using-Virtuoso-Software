Why CMOS Circuits
An interesting obseration was made in the previous section, where we realised that neither NMOS nor PMOS can be used for design that can produce either values, HIGH and LOW. But another thing that is worth notice is how they complement each other. This is what gave rise to an idea of attaching them together. Since, PMOS is a Strong 1, we put it between VDD and Vout and NMOS being a STRONG 0, it is placed between Vout and GND. This way, either can act as a load to the other transistor, since both are never ON together (Are they?). The configuration looks like what we have below. This is referred to as Complimentary Metal Oxide Semiconductor(CMOS) Configuration and it also represents the simplest circuit known as the CMOS Inverter.
